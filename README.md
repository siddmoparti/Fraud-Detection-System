# Fraud Detection System

A machine learning system that analyzes financial transactions and predicts fraudulent behavior in real time using engineered behavioral features and trained classification models.

---

## ðŸš¨ Project Overview

This system processes raw transaction logs, extracts meaningful behavior-based features, and applies trained ML models to detect anomalies that indicate possible fraud attempts.

âœ… Processed **2,000+ labeled financial transactions**  
âœ… Engineered advanced **behavioral & transactional features**  
âœ… Trained multiple ML models (**Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression**)  
âœ… Achieved **87% fraud detection accuracy** on validation set
